Small project to convert arxiv papers to flashcards for studying purposes

Currently uses google's gemini-flash-1.5

CLI arguments: arxiv id required, -k keeps the pdf on your computer, -c changes the number of flashcards from ~10

It seems to be a bit iffy on the number of cards generated, planning to test out some other prompts
